    question: 'What type of visa do I need to enter Indonesia for work or investment?',
    answer: 'It depends on your purpose of stay. If you’re coming for employment, you’ll need a work visa followed by a KITAS (Temporary Stay Permit). For business or investment, there are specific visas such as investor KITAS or multiple-entry business visas. Our team can help you find the right fit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to process a KITAS?',
    answer: 'On average, KITAS processing takes 10–20 business days, depending on the type (work, investor, spouse, etc.), the completeness of your documents, and the immigration office workload. With our full support, we ensure everything is submitted correctly and efficiently to avoid delays.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I bring my spouse or children under my visa or KITAS?',
    answer: 'Yes. If you hold a valid KITAS (work or investor), you can sponsor a dependent KITAS for your legally married spouse and children under 18. We’ll handle all necessary documentation and coordination with immigration.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I entered Indonesia on a business visa. Can I apply for a KITAS without leaving the country?',
    answer: 'Yes, under certain visa types (like single-entry), it’s possible to convert to a KITAS without exiting the country—but only if specific conditions are met. We can assess your visa type and advise on the correct next step.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What’s the difference between KITAS and KITAP?',
    answer: 'KITAS is a temporary stay permit valid for 6–24 months, typically for work, investment, or family stay. KITAP is a permanent stay permit valid for 5 years, usually granted after holding a KITAS for several consecutive years or if married to an Indonesian spouse.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I overstay my visa or KITAS?',
    answer: 'Overstaying is taken seriously in Indonesia. Penalties include daily fines (IDR 1,000,000/day), possible detention, deportation, and even blacklisting. If your permit is close to expiry, contact us immediately—we’ll help you extend or transition legally.',
