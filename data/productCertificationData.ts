    question: 'What is the difference between BPOM and Halal certification?',
    answer: 'BPOM certification is mandatory and focuses on the safety, quality, and health standards of a product. Halal certification is for compliance with Islamic law and, while not always mandatory, is highly expected by the majority of Indonesian consumers for food and cosmetic products.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is SNI certification mandatory for all products?',
    answer: 'No, but it is mandatory for a specific list of products regulated by the government to protect consumer safety. Importing products on this list without an SNI mark can result in customs seizure and legal penalties.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does product registration take?',
    answer: 'The timeline varies significantly by certification type. POSTEL can be relatively quick (a few weeks), while BPOM and SNI can take several months due to laboratory testing and complex documentation requirements. We help streamline this process as much as possible.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I apply for these certifications as a foreign company?',
    answer: 'Generally, no. The applicant and license holder for product certifications must be a legally established Indonesian entity (like a PT PMA). We can assist in setting up this entity or provide solutions to facilitate the registration process on your behalf.',
